* 64 inputs to neural net (each square of board). -1 = black, 0 = empty, 1 = white
* 1 output (0-63), round to square of board to play on

* Copy list of genomes from NEAT.
* Each adjacent genome plays a match against each other.
	* This match involves querying each neural net 32 times for moves.
* Knockout losers and assign them fitness based on what score they had at the end
* Repeat this process assigning bonus fitness to winners of later rounds.
* When there is only one genome left return all of the fitnesses back to NEAT.
* Config:
    * No fitness target
    * Set number of generations
    * Hopefully the best one learns the game.
